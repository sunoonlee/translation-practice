He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. 
In the first forty days a boy had been with him. 
But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. 
It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.
The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.

一位老人在湾流中乘着小船独自捕鱼，他已经连着八十四天一无所获了。
开始的四十天里，有个男孩子和他在一起。
但后来男孩的父母看老人捕不到鱼，说他肯定是瘟神附体了，叫孩子换到另一条船上去帮忙。结果那边一个星期里就捕到了三条大鱼。
男孩看到老人每天都空着船回来，很是难过。他常常帮着搬些东西：线圈，鱼叉，还有绕着桅杆收起来的船帆。
那船帆上打着面粉袋子做的补丁，收拢在一处，看着像一面宣告着永远失败的旗子。
